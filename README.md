# Fading Memories
## First Person Narrative Puzzle Adventure

Fading Memories places you in the shoes of a dedicated nurse, navigating the emotional terrain of caring for elderly Alzheimer's patients. In this first-person, story-driven puzzle game, immerse yourself in the challenges and intricacies of memory loss, forming genuine connections with those you care for.

The purpose of this game was to rapidy prototype. During the three weeks, the team and I worked on created a viable vertical slice for future development.

My main tasks were creating and sustaining the interactable system (IInteractable.cs). Primarily, it was used to abstract how the player interacts with the puzzle objects so less code was needed on new systems that were implaced. In addition to this, I worked on creating and engineering the highlightable aspect of the game (HighlightableObject.cs), indicating to the player objects of interest without taking them out of the immersive aspect of the game. Furthermore, many aspects of the task amangement system (TaskList.cs, TaskMenuUI.cs and TaskMenuUIManager.cs) were created and handled by me to ensure effect playthrough systems.
